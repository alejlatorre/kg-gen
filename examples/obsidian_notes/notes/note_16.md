# Social Constructs Analysis

## Definition and Examples
- Social constructs are ideas created and accepted by people in a society
- Examples: [[Money]], [[Gender Roles]], [[Nations]], [[Social Class]]
- They exist through collective agreement rather than physical reality

> "Reality is socially constructed and must be interpreted from the perspectives of those involved." - Peter L. Berger

### Key Theoretical Frameworks
- [[Social Constructionism]]: How shared meanings are created
- [[Symbolic Interactionism]]: How symbols mediate social interactions
- [[Critical Theory]]: How power structures maintain constructs

This analysis connects to ideas in [[note_10.md|Sapiens Book Notes]] about "intersubjective realities" and relates to [[note_02.md|Stoicism Philosophy Notes]] on distinguishing between objective reality and subjective judgments.

## Research Questions
1. How do social constructs influence individual identity?
2. What role does language play in maintaining constructs?
3. How do constructs evolve over time?
