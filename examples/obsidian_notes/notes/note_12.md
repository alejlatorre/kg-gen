## Strategic Priorities
- Complete [[ML platform]] v2.0 release
- Onboard 3 new team members
- Improve model inference speed by 40%
- Launch [[feature store]] for cross-team usage

> We need to focus on scalability challenges as our user base grows beyond 100k monthly active users

### Resource Allocation
| Project | Engineering Hours | Budget | Priority |
|---------|------------------|--------|----------|
| ML Platform | 1200 | $85K | High |
| Feature Store | 800 | $60K | Medium |
| DevOps Automation | 400 | $30K | Low |

## Challenges Identified
