# Information Overload: Causes and Solutions

## The Problem
- Average person consumes ~174 newspapers worth of information daily
- Human working memory can only hold 4-7 items simultaneously
- Attention switching costs reduce productivity by 40%
- [[Decision fatigue]] increases with information volume

> "The wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients." - Herbert Simon

### Personal Strategies
1. Implement [[information filters]] (RSS, curated newsletters)
2. Practice [[digital minimalism]] (batch processing email, notifications off)
3. Use [[progressive summarization]] technique for notes
4. Create [[decision frameworks]] for common choices

This connects to my [[note_04.md|Personal Knowledge Management System]] and approaches from [[note_11.md|Learning Methodology Framework]].

## Cognitive Impact
| State | Symptoms | Remedies |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Overload | Anxiety, poor decisions | Simplify, prioritize |
| Underload | Boredom, seeking stimulation | Deep work, flow state |
| Optimal | Focused attention, clarity | Regular maintenance |

```
Information Diet = Conscious Consumption + Strategic Ignorance
```

My experiment with [[note_06.md|Digital Sabbath]] practice has been particularly effective at combating information fatigue.
