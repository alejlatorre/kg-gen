# Book Notes: "Atomic Habits" by James Clear

## Core Framework: The Four Laws
- 1st Law: Make it **obvious** (cues)
- 2nd Law: Make it **attractive** (craving)
- 3rd Law: Make it **easy** (response)
- 4th Law: Make it **satisfying** (reward)

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

### Habit Stacking Method
```
After [current habit], I will [new habit].
```

Example: After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 2 minutes.

## Identity-Based Habits
The most effective way to change habits is to focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve. This connects to ideas in [[note_06.md|Personal Reflection: Creating Habits]].

- Instead of "I want to read more books," think "I am a reader"
- Instead of "I need to exercise," think "I am an athletic person"

### Habit Tracking
| Habit | Consistency | Difficulty | Impact |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Reading | 85% | Low | Medium |
| Exercise | 60% | Medium | High |
| Meditation | 75% | Low | High |

The concept of [[habit environment design]] has been particularly useful in restructuring my workspace to make productive behaviors more automatic.
