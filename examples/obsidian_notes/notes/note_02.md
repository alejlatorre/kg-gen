# Stoicism Philosophy Notes

## Core Principles
- Focus only on what you can control
- Accept the [[nature]] of the world as it is
- Practice [[virtues]]: wisdom, courage, justice, temperance

> "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts." - Marcus Aurelius

The Stoics believed that negative emotions result from incorrect judgments, which are under our control.

### Key Stoic Thinkers
- [[Seneca]] - Roman philosopher and statesman
- [[Marcus Aurelius]] - Emperor and philosopher
- [[Epictetus]] - Former slave who taught philosophy

Their teachings continue to influence modern [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] approaches to mental health.

My reflections from [[meditation]] session today:
- Identified three instances of anxiety from external events
- Practiced viewing situations with [[objective judgment]]
- Applied the "view from above" technique to gain perspective
