# Cloud Migration Strategy

## Current State Assessment
- Legacy system running on on-premises hardware
- Monolithic architecture with tight coupling
- Manual deployment process (2-3 days)
- Scaling limitations during peak usage

> The goal is not just to "lift and shift" but to modernize our architecture for cloud-native benefits

### Migration Phases
| Phase | Focus | Timeline | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1: Discovery | Inventory & Dependencies | 6 weeks | Completed |
| 2: Planning | Architecture & Roadmap | 8 weeks | In Progress |
| 3: Execution | Migration & Validation | 24 weeks | Not Started |
| 4: Optimization | Performance Tuning | 12 weeks | Not Started |

## Technical Approach
```
┌───────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ Containerize  │─────►│ Microservices   │─────►│ Kubernetes   │
│ Applications  │      │ Decomposition   │      │ Orchestration│
└───────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

The approach follows principles from [[note_15.md|System Design Principles]] and builds on lessons from [[note_09.md|Distributed Systems Architecture]].

Key challenges include:
- Maintaining [[data integrity]] during migration
- Managing [[stateful components]]
- Ensuring [[backward compatibility]] for APIs
- Training team on [[cloud-native]] practices
