# Learning Methodology Framework

## Effective Learning Components
- [[Active Recall]]: Testing yourself rather than passive review
- [[Spaced Repetition]]: Reviewing content at increasing intervals
- [[Interleaving]]: Mixing different topics in study sessions
- [[Elaboration]]: Explaining concepts in your own words

> "The one who does the work does the learning" - teaching others is the ultimate test of understanding

### Personal System
1. Take [[Cornell notes]] during initial exposure
2. Create [[flashcards]] for key concepts within 24 hours
3. Schedule [[review sessions]] using spaced repetition algorithm
4. Teach concepts to others or create explanatory content

This system builds on research from [[cognitive psychology]] and connects to my [[note_04.md|Personal Knowledge Management System]].

## Retention Metrics
| Method | 24hr Retention | 1wk Retention | 1mo Retention |
|--------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Passive Reading | 20% | 10% | <5% |
| Active Recall | 60% | 45% | 30% |
| Recall + Spaced Rep | 80% | 70% | 60% |

My current focus is improving my [[mental models]] for complex systems through deliberate practice.
