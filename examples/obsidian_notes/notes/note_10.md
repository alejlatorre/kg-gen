# Book Notes: "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari

## Key Themes
- [[Cognitive Revolution]]: How language and abstract thinking transformed humans
- [[Agricultural Revolution]]: Transition from hunter-gatherer to farming societies
- [[Scientific Revolution]]: Emergence of modern thought and technology
- [[Money]]: Universal medium of exchange based on shared beliefs

> "The truly unique trait of Sapiens is our ability to create and believe fiction. All other animals use their communication system to describe reality. We use our communication system to create new realities."

### Impact on My Thinking
This book fundamentally changed how I view human [[culture]] as a set of shared myths and stories. It connects to ideas in [[note_02.md|Stoicism Philosophy Notes]] about how our perceptions shape our reality.

## Historical Patterns
| Era | Years Ago | Key Development |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| Cognitive | 70,000 | Language, abstract thought |
| Agricultural | 12,000 | Farming, permanent settlements |
| Scientific | 500 | Empirical method, technology |

The concept of [[intersubjective reality]] - things that exist because people collectively believe in them (money, nations, corporations) - is particularly relevant to my research on [[note_16.md|Social Constructs]].
