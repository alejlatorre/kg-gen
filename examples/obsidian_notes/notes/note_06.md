# Personal Reflection: Creating Habits

## Current Habits Assessment
- Morning meditation: 15 minutes daily (70% consistent)
- Physical exercise: 30 minutes (40% consistent)
- [[Deep work]] sessions: 2 hours (55% consistent)
- Evening [[journal]]: 10 minutes (80% consistent)

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

### Habit Formation Framework
1. Identify the [[cue]] that triggers the behavior
2. Establish a [[routine]] that's easy to follow
3. Ensure there's a [[reward]] that reinforces the behavior
4. Repeat until the behavior becomes automatic

This connects to ideas in [[note_13.md|Atomic Habits]] and [[note_08.md|Behavior Change Models]].

My biggest obstacle seems to be establishing consistent exercise habits. Research shows that [[implementation intentions]] ("I will exercise at 7am in the living room") significantly increases follow-through.
