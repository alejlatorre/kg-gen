# Behavioral Economics Principles

## Key Concepts
- [[Bounded Rationality]]: Humans make decisions with limited information
- [[Prospect Theory]]: People value gains and losses differently
- [[Mental Accounting]]: How people categorize and evaluate economic outcomes
- [[Herd Behavior]]: Following others in decision making

> Traditional economics assumes rational actors; behavioral economics acknowledges human irrationality

### Applications
- Retirement savings ("opt-out" vs "opt-in" policies)
- Health decisions (default options for organ donation)
- Consumer behavior (decoy pricing strategies)

This field bridges [[psychology]] and [[economics]], showing how cognitive biases affect financial decisions. It connects to ideas in [[note_03.md|Thinking, Fast and Slow]].

## Research Notes
Richard Thaler's work on [[nudge theory]] demonstrates how subtle environmental changes can influence behavior without restricting freedom of choice.

My own experiments with [[choice architecture]] at work:
- Rearranged cafeteria to promote healthier options
- Changed default meeting length from 60 to 45 minutes
- Made sustainability metrics visible on team dashboards
