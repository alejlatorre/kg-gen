# Transfer Learning Techniques

## Core Concept
- Use knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve a related problem
- Especially powerful for deep learning with limited training data
- Builds on pre-trained models (often on ImageNet or similar large datasets)

> "Transfer learning is the key to making deep learning practical for many applications"

### Common Approaches
| Technique | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Feature Extraction | Use pre-trained network as feature extractor | Small datasets |
| Fine-Tuning | Retrain part of pre-trained network | Medium datasets |
| Progressive Freezing | Gradually unfreeze layers | Customized approach |

```python
# TensorFlow implementation example
base_model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(
    weights='imagenet',  # Load pre-trained weights
    include_top=False,   # Exclude classification layer
    input_shape=(224, 224, 3)
)

# Freeze base model
base_model.trainable = False

# Add new classification head
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

This technique was crucial for my [[note_14.md|Image Classification Project]] and connects to concepts in [[note_07.md|Neural Networks Architecture]].

The most important consideration is selecting an appropriate base model that was trained on data similar to your target domain.
