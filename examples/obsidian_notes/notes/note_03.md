# Book Notes: "Thinking, Fast and Slow"

## Two Systems
- System 1: Fast, intuitive, automatic thinking
- System 2: Slow, deliberate, analytical thinking

> The central thesis: humans use two distinct systems of thought that often conflict

### Cognitive Biases Identified
- [[Anchoring Effect]] - Relying too heavily on first information
- [[Availability Heuristic]] - Overestimating likelihood of things that come readily to mind
- [[Loss Aversion]] - Preferring to avoid losses over acquiring gains

## Personal Insights
This book connects well with my [[decision making]] framework and explains why I sometimes make irrational choices despite knowing better. It relates to [[note_08.md|Behavioral Economics]] principles.

```
Decision = System 1 (intuition) + System 2 (analysis) - Cognitive Biases
```

The author's experimental work earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics despite being a psychologist by training.
